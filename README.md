# Memory Game

## What to work on next
- Add themes to the cards (games [fortnite], animals, etc)
- Add a username inputter that gets put on the leaderboard modal with timed score
- Add a leaderboard modal that pops up when you beat your own highscore
- If you get one match incorrect it flips everything back over (hardcore mode)

## Things broken
- Have to fully reset timer and everything after win
- Animation for cards after clicking new game doesn't work
